Scope of Work: Daily Trivia Bot for Discord
*This scope of work was generated using AI based on prompts using the original project guidelines

1. Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Daily Trivia Bot for Discord using Python. The bot will fetch trivia questions from an API or a predefined dataset, post them in a Discord server, accept user responses, validate answers, and maintain a leaderboard.


2. Project Objectives
•	Automate daily trivia questions in a Discord server.
•	Fetch questions from an API (e.g., Open Trivia Database) or a local dataset.
•	Collect and validate user responses.
•	Track and display user scores over time.
•	Ensure the bot runs reliably with minimal manual intervention.


3. Features & Functionality
Core Features
•	Question Fetching:
•	Retrieve a new trivia question daily from an API or dataset.
•	Randomize question selection if using a dataset.
•	Message Handling:
•	Post the daily trivia question in a specific Discord channel.
•	Accept user answers via text commands or reactions.
•	Provide immediate feedback on correctness.
•	Score Tracking:
•	Maintain a leaderboard of user scores.
•	Assign points based on correct responses.
•	Store user scores persistently (using a database or JSON file).
•	Leaderboard & Stats:
•	Allow users to check their scores using a command.
•	Display top participants in the server.
•	Bot Commands:
•	!trivia → Manually trigger a trivia question.
•	!answer <your_answer> → Submit an answer.
•	!score → Show user’s current score.
•	!leaderboard → Display top scorers.
•	!help → List available commands.

Additional Features (Optional/Future Enhancements)
•	Timer-based auto-closing of responses.
•	Different difficulty levels for questions.
•	Category selection (e.g., science, history, etc.).
•	Bonus points for streaks.
•	Integration with Discord roles for rewards.


4. Tech Stack
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries & APIs:
•	discord.py (for bot interaction with Discord)
•	requests (for API-based trivia fetching)
•	json or sqlite3 (for score storage)
•	Hosting & Deployment:
•	Run locally or deploy on a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Replit).


5. Development Timeline
Phase	Tasks	Time Estimate
Setup	Configure bot, API access	1-2 days
Trivia Logic	Fetch questions, validate answers	3-4 days
Score System	Implement leaderboard, storage	2-3 days
Command Setup	Implement bot commands	2-3 days
Testing	Debug and refine features	2-3 days
Deployment	Host the bot, optimize performance	2-4 days


6. Deliverables
•	A functional Discord bot that posts daily trivia.
•	A scoring and leaderboard system.
•	Well-documented code and setup instructions.
•	Deployment guide (if applicable).


7. Constraints & Assumptions
•	The bot will run in a single Discord server initially.
•	Users will interact via text commands.
•	API-based questions depend on external availability.
•	Persistence method (database or JSON) will be simple for ease of use.


8. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation Strategy
API downtime	Use a fallback dataset
Bot spam or abuse	Implement rate limiting
Data loss	Regular backups of scores
Hosting issues	Ensure auto-restart mechanisms


9. Acceptance Criteria
•	The bot successfully posts trivia questions daily.
•	Users can submit answers, and responses are validated.
•	Scores are accurately tracked and retrievable.
•	The leaderboard correctly ranks users.
